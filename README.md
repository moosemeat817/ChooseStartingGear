# Choose Starting Gear
A mod for The Long Dark. 
This mod allows you to choose your starting gear when starting a new game. 

It is intended for use when starting a new SURVIVAL MODE game. 

The idea is to let you choose whatever you want to enable a more varied experience. 

Perhaps you want to be...
A repairwoman sent to the Cannery only to be trapped by the First Flare ... 
A recluse living in Trappers Cabin ... 
A plane crash survivor ... 
The climber waiting for friends at the Mountaineer's Hut ...  
... You can now outfit yourself for whatever scenario you dream up!

## Requirements
[MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader/releases/latest/download/MelonLoader.Installer.exe)

## Installation:

2. Drop ```ChooseStartingGear.dll``` into your Mods folder
3. If you are updating from an older version, delete the ```ChooseStartingGear.json``` from your Mods folder as old json's can cause errors if the mod's Settings have been changed

## Using The Mod
1. Open the ```Options``` menu
2. Open the ```Mod Settings``` menu

4. Mod Options:
	* ```Game Default:``` Mod is disabled; a new game will have completely unmodified starting gear
		* Recommended option when starting a new Wintermute (Story Mode) or Challenge game
	* ```Default PLUS:``` Add items IN ADDITION to the default starting items
		* You will receive the standard starting items
		* PLUS anything you choose in the mod

		* Clothing you add will equip *after* the default clothing and may end up in the outer slot
	* ```Custom:``` You will choose all of your starting gear and receive nothing else
		* You will still get starting items added by other mods, e.g. [binoculars](https://github.com/ds5678/Binoculars), by using the other mod's settings 
5. To make the menu easier to navigate, items have been separated into the inventory categories:
