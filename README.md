# Choose Starting Gear
This mod allows you to choose your starting gear when starting a new game.

It is intended for use when starting a new SURVIVAL MODE game. 

The idea is to let you choose whatever you want to enable a more varied experience. 

Perhaps you want to be...
A repairwoman sent to the Cannery only to be trapped by the First Flare ... 
A recluse living in Trappers Cabin ... 
A plane crash survivor ... 
The climber waiting for friends at the Mountaineer's Hut ...  
... You can now outfit yourself for whatever scenario you dream up!

## Using The Mod
1. Open the ```Options``` menu
2. Open the ```Mod Settings``` menu
3. Scroll across to the ```Choose Starting Gear``` menu
4. Mod Options:
	* ```Game Default:``` Mod is disabled; a new game will have completely unmodified starting gear
		* Recommended option when starting a new Wintermute (Story Mode) or Challenge game
	* ```Default PLUS:``` Add items IN ADDITION to the default starting items
		* You will receive the standard starting items
		* PLUS anything you choose in the mod
		* E.g. you want the standard starting gear PLUS a hatchet and some Ketchup Chips
		* Clothing you add will equip *after* the default clothing and may end up in the outer slot
	* ```Custom:``` You will choose all of your starting gear and receive nothing else
		* You will still get starting items added by other mods by using the other mod's settings 
5. To make the menu easier to navigate, items have been separated into the inventory categories:
	* Clothing
	* Fire Starting
	* First Aid
	* Food and Drink
	* Tools
	* Materials
6. Each category can be toggled to show/hide
